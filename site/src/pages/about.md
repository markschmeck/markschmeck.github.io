#### Who am I?

My name is Mark Schmechel and I am from Meadville, Pennsylvania. I am currently a Senior at Allegheny College majoring in Economics with a minor in Computer Science. When choosing the path I have, my dream has always been to work in the sports industry, specifically the NBA.

Throughout my life and experiences I have been building up the skills and passion needed to exist and thrive in the industry. I have been a die-hard Philadelphia sports fan since the first day I can even remember sports, all thanks to my dad. As anyone who knows any Philadelphia sports fan should know; they are some of the most passionate fans you will find anywhere. This trend followed right down the line to me. It is through this passion and longtime love for the games that will allow me to excel in any role I undertake. I grew up watching my dad work hard his whole life and I live by that philosophy as well. Anything I do, I do a my best no matter what which allows me to fulfill any responsibility.

I have attempted to try and learn from all of my experiences in order to make me a great candidate for an NBA job. Throughout my life I have worked multiple different jobs and have gained useful experiences from them. Things such as customer service, time management, and teamwork are valuable skills I have learned from my time in retail. Working at the YMCA taught me how to multitask and deal with tough situations throughout covid. In addition, I recent started helping out the school with the men's basketball team which has been great in teaching me how to work around higher level basketball.

Some of my favorite hobbies are to hangout with friends, go camping in my car camper, fishing whenever I can get out, basketball, watching sports, and cooking to name a few. Even through these activities, I feel as though I can learn something valuable to further my career. Fishing teaches patience while cooking relies on accuracy and attention. All of my experiences will hopefully culminate with my dream job of working in the NBA as a coach or general manager.
